# Iris-Classification

# Data Import and Exploration:

Imports essential data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Loads the Iris flower dataset from a CSV file ('iris.csv') into a Pandas DataFrame.
Displays the first few rows of the dataset to provide an initial overview.
Checks for missing values and displays the percentage of missing values for each column.
Examines the data types of columns and the distribution of flower species in the dataset.

# Data Visualization:

Utilizes Seaborn for data visualization, including pair plots to visualize feature relationships and histograms for feature distributions.
Creates histograms to display the distribution of features for each flower species.
Generates line plots to compare sepal and petal length and width.

# Model Building:

Preprocesses the data by encoding the 'label' column using LabelEncoder and splitting it into features (X) and the target variable (y).
Splits the data into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).
Builds and evaluates two machine learning models: Decision Tree Classifier and K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier.
Computes accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports for model evaluation.

# Future Usage:

This script serves as a foundational example of a data analysis and machine learning project for the Iris flower dataset. Its future usage and applications include:

 ## Educational Tool: 
 The script can be used as an educational resource for teaching data preprocessing, data visualization, and model building using a well-known dataset.

## Benchmarking: 
It can serve as a benchmark or reference point for evaluating other classification algorithms or machine learning models on the Iris dataset.

## Prototyping: 
Researchers or data scientists can adapt and extend this script as a starting point for prototyping and experimenting with different machine learning models and techniques.

## Comparative Analysis:
Users can compare the performance of additional classifiers or feature engineering methods on the Iris dataset and extend the script accordingly.

## Documentation: 
The script can be documented and included in data science or machine learning project portfolios to showcase data analysis and classification skills.

## Automation: 
Components of this script can be automated for batch processing or integrated into larger data pipelines for automated classification tasks.

In summary, this script provides a comprehensive overview of data analysis and machine learning tasks on a classic dataset and can be used for educational purposes, research, and as a starting point for more advanced data science projects.
